# CookieStealer
Cookie stealer

**javascript.html** contains the java script code used to obtain the document cookie
and post it to the log.php.

**log.php** writes the cookies to a file for later use ;)
Optionally you can use the base64JavascriptEncoded.html instead of javascript.html 
since it uses base64 encoding to "hide" the log.php file from newbie eyes.


**transparentProxy.sh**
A script to create a transparent proxy
